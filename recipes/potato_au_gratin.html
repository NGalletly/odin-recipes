    <h2>How to make Potatoes au Gratin</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes, garlic, and salt into a large pot; fill with enough
        water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer
        potatoes until tender but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes. Use a slotted
        spoon to transfer about half the potatoes into a 9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1/2 of the cream over the potatoes and season with black pepper and
        nutmeg; sprinkle 1/2 of the Gruyère cheese on top. Layer the remaining
        potatoes on top and season with black pepper and nutmeg. Pour over
        remaining cream and sprinkle with remaining Gruyère cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown on top, about 1
        hour.
      </li>
    </ol>
